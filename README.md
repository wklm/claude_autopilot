## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Project settings
CLAUDE_PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/carenji
CLAUDE_PROMPT_TEXT="Your development task"

# Firebase settings
CLAUDE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=carenji-24ab8
CLAUDE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS_ENABLED=true

# Flutter MCP settings  
CLAUDE_MCP_ENABLED=true
CLAUDE_MCP_VMSERVICE_PORT=8182
CLAUDE_MCP_DDS_PORT=8181

# Agent behavior
CLAUDE_WAIT_ON_LIMIT=true
CLAUDE_RESTART_ON_COMPLETE=true
CLAUDE_CHECK_INTERVAL=5
```

### Configuration File (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the agent directory:

```env
# Carenji project location
CLAUDE_PROJECT_PATH=/home/user/dev/carenji

# Default prompt
CLAUDE_PROMPT_TEXT=Help develop carenji following CLAUDE.md guidelines

# Enable all carenji features
CLAUDE_CARENJI_FEATURES_ENABLED=medication_management,vitals_monitoring,staff_scheduling,family_portal,barcode_scanning
```

## üî• Firebase Emulator Integration

### Using Docker Compose Emulators

```bash
# Start with Firebase emulators
docker-compose --profile with-emulators up -d

# Emulator ports:
# - 4000: Emulator UI
# - 8079: Firestore  
# - 9098: Auth
# - 5001: Functions
# - 9199: Storage

# Install Claude CLI on host
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli

# Or mount from host in docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - /usr/local/bin/claude:/usr/local/bin/claude:ro
```

### Firebase Emulators Not Starting
```bash
# Check ports are available
lsof -i :8079,9098,5001,4001

# Use alternative ports in docker-compose.yml
```

### Flutter MCP Not Connecting
