   - Create emulator helper utilities
   - Migrate first critical test file

2. **Week 1 Goals**
   - Complete all blocked files
   - Migrate 15 critical priority files
   - Set up CI/CD emulator support

3. **Success Metrics**
   - All tests passing with emulators
   - Test execution time < 10 minutes
   - Zero flaky tests
   - 100% migration completion
