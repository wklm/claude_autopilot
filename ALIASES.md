# Claude Flutter Agent - Alias Reference Card ðŸš€

All commands automatically append " ultrathink" to enable Claude's thinking mode.

## Basic Commands
```bash
cfa "Your prompt here"           # Run with a direct prompt
cfa @requirements.md            # Run with prompt from file
cfa-attach                      # Attach to running session
cfa-stop                        # Stop running session
cfa-config                      # Show configuration

```

## Quick Actions

cfa-fix                         # Fix Flutter analyzer errors
cfa-test                        # Write comprehensive tests
cfa-lint                        # Run flutter analyze and fix issues

```

## Development Workflow
```bash
cfa-feature prompt.md           # Run with a feature specification file
cfa-review                      # Review code for best practices

cfa-doc                         # Add missing documentation
```

## Carenji-Specific
```bash
cfa-carenji                     # Switch to carenji directory and run
cfa-carenji-firebase            # Set up Firebase emulators
cfa-carenji-test                # Run all tests and fix failures

```

## Examples

### Simple task:
```bash
cfa "Add a loading spinner to the login screen"
```

### Complex feature:
```bash
echo "Create a medication reminder feature with:
- Daily notifications
- Snooze functionality
- History tracking
- Family notifications" > feature.md

cfa @feature.md
```

### Quick fixes:

- Use `@filename` syntax for longer prompts
- The agent restarts automatically after each task
- Usage limits are handled with smart retry logic
